"The Canton of Solothurn provides services and infrastructure to 250,000 "
"Solothurn citizens. In the year 2001 the State Parliament decided to migrate "
"from Windows to Linux. The motivations were to be independent from one "
"particular vendor, to encourage free enterprise and reduce license costs. As "
"a result SO!GIS department of the Canton of Solothurn started to deliver the "
"GIS-requirements of more than 3500 employees with a FOSSGIS strategy. The "
"first step we took was the introduction of UMN MapServer and the creation of "
"a SO!MAP client that offers an easy to use WebGIS client for all the 3500 "
"employees. The second step was the migration of all our geospatial data from "
"Shapefiles to the PostGIS spatial database engine. The introduction was very "
"successful, but an easy to use desktop GIS was lacking. After an evaluation "
"of different Desktop GIS we decided to use QGIS in conjunction with GRASS, "
"replacing ESRI ArcInfo and ArcView3 in the 2006."

"In contrast to the interactive maps served by UMN MapServer, the desktop GIS "
"has to offer a flexible view at the geospatial data of Solothurn. QGIS "
"Desktop GIS is in use by more than 50 users for their daily work. But many "
"of them are not GIS experts. They want to visualize and/or capture "
"geospatial data with an intuitive user interface. One of the most important "
"Desktop GIS issues is the question: \"How do I get the information from the "
"PostGIS geodata repository I need?\". Since our end users are unfamiliar "
"with data models and the underlying structures of our spatial database, "
"offering the users a raw connection to the PostGIS DB was not an option. We "
"have a metadata database that stores the descriptions of all production data "
"called 'SO!DATA'. SO!DATA contains a human readable inventory of the data "
"models and the non-GIS-Expert user is able to use this database to discover "
"the information they need."

"To remove the need for end users to interact directly with PostGIS "
"connections and table selection dialogs, a plugin has been developed in "
"python. The plugin is called \"SO!GIS Layer\" (see Figure 1). The plugin "
"connects to the SO!GIS PostGIS repository, gets the information of all "
"published geospatial data layers from SO!DATA and offers the user a GUI to "
"find the data layers they need. With this infrastructure in place, our users "
"are happy - they can prepare for geoprocessing, editing and map composing in "
"an individual way."

"Another required QGIS plugin we created is called 'SO!GIS Suche'. This "
"provides the possibility to search for locations like townships, addresses "
"or cadastral parcels (see Figure 2). As a result the user is able to "
"navigate very easily to an area of interest. At the moment many other "
"plugins are under development. These will support data manipulation, "
"analysis or mapping for different projects. Our in-development plugins cover "
"topics  such as nature reserves, soil conservation, cadastral data "
"verification, crisis management, abandoned sites and so on."

"Today we can say that using QGIS was the right decision for us. QGIS offers "
"most of the features requested by our users. The Canton of Solothurn "
"subcontracts the creation of features that QGIS lacks to commercial support "
"providers. With PyQgis and PyQt there are excellent options for easy in-"
"house application development based on QGIS. One huge benefit is the "
"unlimited number of installations. Everyone who needs to use QGIS can use it "
"without any limitations. To push the development of QGIS the Canton of "
"Solothurn has invested approximately $30,000 into QGIS every year since "
"2007. This is much more efficient and target-oriented than the payment of "
"support into the black box of our former software provider. Apart from using "
"FOSSGIS, the Canton of Solothurn also provides public geodata free of charge "
"via the SO!ONLINE web portal."
