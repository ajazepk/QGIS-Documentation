"I started applying GIS to my work in biogeography about 10 years ago. "
"Through my graduate internship, PhD work and two other research jobs, I used "
"the proprietary software packages that were available and used at my "
"workplaces – mainly CartaLinx, Idrisi, ArcView and ArcGIS. But I found it "
"rather annoying that we were constantly dealing with license renewal issues, "
"and that I could not use the software away from the workplace unless I "
"acquired my own license."

"It crossed my mind on several occasions that switching to free software "
"would spare me those problems. However, there was prejudice against the "
"analytical capabilities of free software, and even after I heard about the "
"potential of GRASS, I was still reluctant because I thought it would be too "
"difficult to learn. I was also afraid it would be cumbersome to migrate all "
"the maps and analyses that I had done so far. At the beginning of my post-"
"doc in 2008, I finally gave it an opportunity and took a training course on "
"Quantum GIS and GRASS. It was probably the best decision of my professional "
"life! I found that QGIS provided a very intuitive interface for GRASS, hat "
"they complemented each other perfectly, and they provided all the analytical "
"capabilities I needed. I started using both programs immediately after the "
"course. Not only did I begin all my new GIS work with QGIS/GRASS [e.g. 1,2], "
"but I also did follow-up analyses on previous works that I had done with "
"commercial software. For example, I had built models of otter [3] and desman "
"[4] distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. After switching to QGIS-GRASS, I "
"analysed how those models behaved when downscaled to a finer resolution [5]. "
"Another previous work on biogeographic relationships between Iberian lynx "
"and rabbit [6] had a follow-up after I switched to QGIS-GRASS [7]. Not only "
"did I not have any problems with the migration of the data and previous "
"results: I also found it much easier to do the things I wanted to do with "
"the new software, and was able to do extra analyses which I could not have "
"done with the programs I used before."

"All in all, switching to Quantum GIS/GRASS brought me nothing but "
"advantages. I can now work freely at work, at home and on my laptop on the "
"move, without having to worry about software licenses or moving to new "
"institutions. Open-source software covers all my research needs and gives me "
"the freedom I longed for."
