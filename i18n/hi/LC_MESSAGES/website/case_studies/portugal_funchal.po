"There will be democratic teaching in our schools or education communities "
"when we generalize the use of Open Source software. This demands not only a "
"change in people's way of thinking (sometimes molded by advertising), but "
"also a sustainable management of expenses and, indirectly, fighting against "
"software piracy. These advantages which are inherent to the philosophy of "
"the Open Source software will be the model to follow if we want a quality "
"education without boundaries or dependencies of any kind. From this "
"perspective, class 35 of the 12th grade belonging to the technological "
"course of territory and environment at Jaime Moniz Secondary School, uses "
"QGIS to develop activities proposed in Geographical Information Systems, "
"Applied Information Systems and during their training period. Within the "
"range of options of free GIS, there were three underlying reasons for the "
"choice of Open Source selection: the user friendly and intuitive approach, "
"supported by online information provided by forums; the several software "
"plug-ins and the quality of the product in its final stage. (One should bear "
"in mind that these academic works were done by students who belong to a very "
"young age group.)"

"Expectation was the most dominating feeling in the firth lessons! The group "
"of students had only a theoretical and somewhat vague knowledge about the "
"issue of GIS. It was, therefore, necessary to link practical activities to "
"that theoretical knowledge - at first, through the gathering of geographical "
"information by using a support map, within the school's perimeter, and "
"later, by using a GPS, concerning the area surrounding the school. In "
"figures 1 and 2 it is possible to view some of the activities developed in "
"class."

"Number of the inhabitants (example) Generally speaking, QGIS allured the "
"students: “to accomplish basic functions of GIS through exercise "
"associations of graphic and non-graphic elements”; “to upload alphanumeric "
"data”; “use functions of spacial analysis”; “to make thematic maps”; “to "
"make a Digital Elevation Model” and, last but not least, “to recognize the "
"relevance of a free GIS for the analysis of geographical  information, as "
"well for the sustainable management of the territory”. These theoretical and "
"practical purposes are achieved together along with other goals, extremely "
"important in the education context, such as: “creating a diversified "
"educational experience”; “being in contact with local reality” and "
"“developing a constructive, positive and critical mind”."

"for the accomplishment of these school works”. At present, the website is a "
"motivation source for the follow up of the whole teaching process."

"In a flashback analysis of the whole process, I feel that the idea of using "
"QGIS, as a tool, to accomplish some teaching purposes, was an excellent "
"choice. At first, its use involved a lot of expectation. I had never used "
"GIS before and, therefore, I was learning and teaching at the same time. The "
"fact that the GIS turned out to be extremely user friendly together, with "
"the information available online, was a blessing for me. Moreover, the "
"school did not have to pay for another software license nor it was dependent "
"on license renewals, which substantially improved the teaching quality, "
"without any extra expenses. At present, students use QGIS almost on their "
"own to accomplish their different work plans. I hope the final result shows "
"the amount of effort involved in the whole learning process."
