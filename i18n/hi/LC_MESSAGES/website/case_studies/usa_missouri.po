"The Missouri Herpetological Atlas Project (MOHAP) was initiated in 1997 as a "
"result of the desire to obtain and easily update detailed distribution maps "
"for Missouri (United States of America) amphibians and reptiles. A database "
"was established to store all valid localities, including records published "
"in historical literature sources and specimens vouchered from museums. From "
"the database, a series of maps can be produced representing both locality "
"records and \"county records\" for each species."

"MOHAP hosts a web site at http://atlas.moherp.org/ that describes the "
"project in detail and displays a variety of static maps, all produced by "
"Quantum GIS.  An atlas, published as a downloadable PDF, is released "
"periodically as a gratis publication in the spirit of open access to "
"scientific research (Daniel, R.E. and B.S. Edmond. 2012. Atlas of Missouri "
"Amphibians and Reptiles for 2011. <http://atlas.moherp.org/pubs/atlas11."
"pdf>).  Published maps are used by field biologists, land managers, and "
"others to better understand species' distributions in Missouri."

"As of February 2013, the MOHAP database contained 31,495 entries "
"representing the specimens housed in 34 museum collections and cited in 32 "
"historical literature sources; 5,118 documented county records; 6,884 unique "
"localities; and 12,866 unique species / locality combinations. The state's "
"herpetofauna consists of 113 species."

"The process of creating maps with Quantum GIS starts with data stored in "
"several PostgreSQL tables, spatially-enabled with PostGIS. Because maps are "
"static and ultimately destined for either the web or a printed atlas, they "
"are generated automatically for each species using a custom Quantum GIS "
"Python plugin (Figures 1,2)."

"The final species maps have a clean and professional appearance (Figure 3). "
"To better understand species' distributions, a series of base maps are also "
"created and labelled (Figure 4). Because of the way styles are managed "
"within each data layer, the base map layers can also be incorporated into a "
"set of species maps with little extra effort."

"At the beginning of the MOHAP project, several commercial and proprietary "
"tools were used to store and process data and produce maps for publication. "
"Starting in 2007, we set about to move all aspects of the project to open "
"source software. Quantum GIS, along with PHP, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python, "
"and ReportLab, forms the open source linchpin to MOHAP, effectively allowing "
"the project and all data to exist free of proprietary software "
"entanglements. Quantum GIS contains native support for PostGIS and a Python "
"plugin architecture, which were essential in creating the automated map "
"generation and export. The extensive API documentation was used along with "
"the plugin developer cookbook to create exactly what we needed for the "
"automation. The community support is also very good and includes a huge "
"array of shared plugins built and ready to use. Although we use Quantum GIS "
"in a small and specific way, its capabilities and extensibility using Python "
"is more than sufficient to tackle larger and more complex projects."
