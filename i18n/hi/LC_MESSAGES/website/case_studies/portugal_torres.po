"The Associação Leonel Trindade – Sociedade de História Natural (ALT-SHN) is "
"a non profit institution headquarted in Torres Vedras, Portugal, specialized "
"in paleontology. The institution manages a large fossil collection, mainly "
"from Upper Jurassic. One of the key issues in paleontological management is "
"to assess spatial context of the sites from where the fossils are retrieved "
"– hundreds of sites representing thousands of different specimens."

"Back in 2008, we came up with the idea of exploring GIS technologies to "
"support the investigation and get a more holistic perspective on the "
"heritage we were dealing. This idea boosted SIGAP Project (GIS applied to "
"paleontology) [2]. The project, supported by public and private entities – "
"mainly the Municipalty, Digiterra.hu and the Army's Geographic Institute "
"(IGeoE), aimed three goals:"

"QGIS was the mainframe of all the project. Data was dumped directly to QGIS, "
"and then edited and manipulated in order to achieve the desired outputs. The "
"GRASS interface provided by QGIS allowed us to conduct complex spatial "
"analyis on rasters in order to obtain the risk model we needed to plan our "
"field work and future prospection. Furthermore it allowed us to import "
"PostGIS layers and visualize them on QGIS."

"The choice for QGIS was also encouraged by the multi platform support. The "
"institution has three distinct facilities, and each of those facilities has "
"different systems – We have Mac, Windows PC and Linux PC, therefore it's of "
"extreme importance that we have the freedom to install the software on any "
"machine we want so we don't get stuck to a particular computer."

"The overall experience with QGIS can only be rated has being very good and "
"recommendable. From our point of view, the main advantage of QGIS is that "
"it's not just a GIS software – it's a productivity suite for spatial data. "
"It allowed us to take advantage of other powerful tools within a single work "
"environment. From QGIS you can work with GRASS, with PostGIS, with GPS data, "
"with webservices and with tens of useful plug-ins developed by users "
"worldwide. The user friendly interface is also a big advantage, especially "
"if you have to train first time users has we've done. The easyness of the "
"interface makes production of maps an everyday task and brought people "
"closer to spatial approaches [3]."
