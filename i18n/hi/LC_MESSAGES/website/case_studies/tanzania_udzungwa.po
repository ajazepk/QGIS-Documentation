"Working in southern Tanzania, the Udzungwa Elephant Project (UEP) is using "
"Quantum GIS for its training in wildlife research and conservation. In "
"February 2012, it held a two-day workshop for the Ecology and Protection "
"(anti-poaching) staff of the Udzungwa Mountains National Park, along with "
"members of the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre."

"Trainees used their own laptops and were provided with the installer for "
"QGIS 1.7.3 along with key data layers covering the National Park: protected "
"area boundaries, scanned topographic maps, a DEM, roads, ranger posts, and "
"habitat types."

"By the end of the two days, everyone was able to add GPS download data, "
"create and edit new layers, save map projects, design print composers, and "
"save graphics files for inclusion in reports and presentations - this last "
"feature is specially useful in using GIS to help in normal workflows. Even "
"during the course, National Park staff were using the GIS to view the GPS "
"locations of new-reported elephant carcass locations - the result of "
"poaching - and to start planning responses. QGIS offered us several "
"attractions: not only is it completely free, but its open source nature "
"makes it responsive to particular development needs; it runs well on older "
"computers and has a relatively small installer; and in general we have found "
"it user-friendly for newcomers to GIS."

"The Udzungwa Elephant Project is based next to Tanzania's Udzungwa Mountains "
"National Park, a range of evergreen forested mountains reaching over 2,500 "
"metres. It studies the ecology of elephants in and around the mountains, "
"with the aim of understanding how elephants move between different Tanzanian "
"parks and reserves, and how such corridors might be maintained while "
"reducing crop damage caused by elephants. More widely, elephants are a "
"\"flagship species\" for the conservation of the incredible wildlife and "
"landscapes of southern Tanzania."
