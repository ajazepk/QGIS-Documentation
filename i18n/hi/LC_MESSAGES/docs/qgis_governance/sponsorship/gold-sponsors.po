"QGIS has a policy of providing a 'clean application'. Over the years we have "
"had a great many contributors to the project, both in their personal and in "
"an institutional capacity. From time to time we get requests to include "
"logos, about dialogs etc within the application to recognise these "
"contributions. As you can well imagine, if we agreed to every one of these, "
"the application would be extremely cluttered and visually noisy. Instead we "
"try to offer a number of centralised places where these contributors can be "
"acknowledged, as listed above."
