"Map production is the process of arranging map elements on a sheet of paper "
"in a way that, even without many words, the average person can understand "
"what it is all about. Maps are usually produced for presentations and "
"reports where the audience or reader is a politician, citizen or a learner "
"with no professional background in GIS. Because of this, a map has to be "
"effective in communicating spatial information. Common elements of a map are "
"the title, map body, legend, north arrow, scale bar, acknowledgement, and "
"map border (see  )."

"A map is a simplified representation of the real world and **map symbols** "

"legend is usually shown as a little box in a corner of the map. It contains "
"icons, each of which will represent a type of feature. For example, a "
"*house* icon will show you how to identify houses on the map (see  )."

"**Expressing a scale in words** is a commonly used method and has the "

"fraction (RF)** method, where both the map distance and the ground distance "
"in the real world are given in the same map units, as a ratio. For example, "
"a RF value 1:25,000 means that any distance on the map is 1/25,000*th* of "
"the real distance on the ground (see b ). The value 25,000 in the ratio is "
