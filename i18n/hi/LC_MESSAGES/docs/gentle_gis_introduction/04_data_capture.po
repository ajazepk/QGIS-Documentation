"As you can see it's often not easy to know what type of geometry you will "

"provided by the Chief Directorate : Surveys and Mapping, South Africa, they "
"provide a river areas (polygons) layer and a rivers polyline layer. They use "
"the river areas (polygons) to represent river stretches that are wide, and "
"they use river polylines to represent narrow stretches of river. In   we can "
"see how our tourism layers might look on a map if we used all three geometry "

"One common solution to this problem is to use a raster layer (such as an "
