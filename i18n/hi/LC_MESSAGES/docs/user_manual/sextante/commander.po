"The commander is started from the *Analysis* menu or, more practically, "
"pressing ``Shift + Ctrl + M`` (you can change that default keyboard shortcut "
"in the QGIS configuration if you prefer a different one). Apart from "
"executing SEXTANTE algorithms, the commander gives you access to most of the "
"functionality in QGIS, which means that it gives you a practical and "
"efficient way of running QGIS tasks, and allows you to control QGIS reducing "
"the usage of buttons and menus."
