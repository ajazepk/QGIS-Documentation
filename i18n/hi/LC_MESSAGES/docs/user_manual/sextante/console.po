"The console allows advanced users to increase their productivity and perform "
"complex operations that cannot be performed using any of the other elements "

"``runalg()`` method, which takes the name of the algorithm to execute as its "

"depending on the requirements of the algorithm. So the first thing you need "
"to know is the name of the algorithm to execute. That is not the name you "

"algorithm in detail, which can be used to get a list of the parameters that "
"an algorithms require and the outputs that it will generate. To do it, you "
