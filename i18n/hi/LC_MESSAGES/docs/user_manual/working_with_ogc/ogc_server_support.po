"QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3 and WFS 1.0.0 implementation which, in "
"addition, implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. "
"The QGIS Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application "
"written in C++ that works together with a webserver (e.g. Apache, Lighttpd). "
"It is funded by the EU projects Orchestra, Sany and the city of Uster in "
"Switzerland."

"It uses QGIS as backend for the GIS logic and for map rendering. Furthermore "
"the Qt library is used for graphics and for platform independent C++ "
"programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS Server uses "
"cartographic rules as a configuration language, both for the server "
"configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules."

"Moreover, the QGIS Server project provides the 'Publish to Web' plugin, a "

"As QGIS desktop and QGIS Server use the same visualization libraries, the "
"maps that are published on the web look the same as in desktop GIS. The "
"'Publish to Web' plugin currently supports basic symbolization, with more "
"complex cartographic visualization rules introduced manually. As the "
"configuration is performed with the `SLD standard <http://www.opengeospatial."
"org/standards/sld>`_ and its documented extensions, there is only one "
"standardised language to learn, which greatly simplifies the complexity of "
"creating maps for the Web."
